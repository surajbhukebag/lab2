Smart Emergency System :

Sources of Data : 
	1. Video Camera - captures images
	2. Weather API - if it was rainy or chilly - was it the reason for stay back
	3. Sensors data for identifying people density
	4. Class schedule - was there a deadline for submitting assignment (could be a reason for late night stay) or was there an event which made ppl to stay back 
	
Objective:
	1. Provide emergency support by enabling system to respond to pre-configured risk image patterns (Image gestures) in real time
	
Analysis:
	1. Security breach is happening during what time of the day
	2. Are there people around when the incident took place
	3. Was there an event or assignment due or class or weather codition or any reason for the person to be in campus --- this is not real time data --- this could be used as historical data for analysis
	4. Historical analysis -- kind of security breach, what kind of ppl were targetted, was system intelligent enough to respond in realtime
	5. Based on class schedule data and breach data, suggest a different timing for classes
	
Actionable Insights:
	1. Identify locations that have proven vulnurable for braches and increase security	
	2. Identify target ppl for breaches and provide saftey guides for those ppl
	
	
	
Smart Resource Utilization :
	Usually the resource is shared among people and need to be monitored to make sure it is used efficiently
	
	Eg: ENG390 - Priniting Room
